# Intruder 

This tool is a command-line script for Kali Linux that generates msfvenom payloads for Windows and Android. It allows users to interactively specify platform, LHOST, LPORT, and output file names, with an additional option to embed Android payloads into existing APKs. The tool is designed to streamline payload creation during pentesting.
